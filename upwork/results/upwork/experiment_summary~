Experiments and results

1. For feature selection using PCA, I varied the number of selected features.
The best sets of features are: 
 
Set1: (7 features selected)
DeviceModel
InstallDays
RevokePushAfterDays
RevokePushBefore
UninstalledAfter
UninstalledSameday
UninstalledTF

Set2: (8 features selected)
AllowGeo
DeviceModel
InstallDays
RevokePushAfterDays
RevokePushBefore
UninstalledAfter
UninstalledSameday
UninstalledTF

It seems that the best sets of features are smaller than the set of selected features from my previous experiment (as written in k_mean_summary_all.docx where I allowed more number of features. There are 20 features in that set and the Silhouette coefficient is 0.1749548768057555 ) and maybe a little bit less helpful in explaning clusters. If you prefer the feature set in the previous experiment, please let me know. I will rerun the experiments using that feature set. 

2. The best results from all clustering algorithms are as follows:

2.1 K-means algorithm
 
#features = 7 from Set1
#clusters = 4 
Silhouette coefficient = 0.37357748245083328
  
Here are characters of users in each cluster: 
  
Characters of users in cluster #0:This group of users revoked push token within 1 day since first use date. These users (among 4 clusters) are least likely to uninstall the app 

- Use iPod touch 5G 
- 10.5 days of app launch from installation
- Most of users didn't revoke push token before first use date
- Some users revoked push token within 1 day since first use date
- Most of users Didn't uninstall the app. Users who uninstalled did it  0-2 days after first use date

Characters of users in cluster #1: This group of users revoked push token 1-2 days after first use date. 

- Use iPod touch 5G 
- 9.7 days of app launch from installation
- Most of users didn't revoke push token before first use date
- Some users revoked push token 1-2 day since first use.
- Half of users didn't uninstall the app. Users who uninstalled did it 0-2 days after first use date.  

Characters of users in cluster #2: This group of users didn't revoke push token but they uninstalled the app. They might received too many notifications. 
  
- Use iPod touch 5G 
- 4.3 days of app launch from installation
- All users didn't revoke push token 
- Most of them uninstalled the app. 

Characters of users in cluster #3:
- Use iPod touch 5G 
- 9.3 days of app launch from installation
- Most of users didn't revoke push token before first use date
- Some users revoked push token 1-2 day after first use.
- Half of users didn't uninstall the app. Users who uninstalled did it 0-2 days after first use date.  

- From this result, I think users who revoked push token are more likely to continue using the app than those who din't. And the longer the user keeps the app, the more likely they continue using the app.

2. Birch algorithm 
 
#features = 8 from Set2
#clusters = 4 
Silhouette coefficient = 0.3608858705920554

Here are characters of users in each cluster: 
It seems that the clusters are mainly divided by device model. 

Characters of users in cluster #0: 

- Use iPhone 5s
- 11 days of app launch from installation
- Most of users revoked push token before first use date or within 1 day since first use date
- Most of users didn't uninstall the app. Users who uninstalled did it 2-3 days after first use date

Characters of users in cluster #1: 

- Use iPad mini 1G
- 11 days of app launch from installation
- Most of users revoked push token before first use date or on the same day as first use date
- Most of users  uninstalled the app 0-1 day since first use date

Characters of users in cluster #2: 

- Use iPhone 6
- 28 days of app launch from installation
- Most of users revoked push token 12 day after first use date
- Most of users didn't uninstall the app 
- A few of users  uninstalled the app 0-1 day since first use date

Characters of users in cluster #3: 

- Use iPod touch 5G
- 4 days of app launch from installation
- Most of users didn't revoke push token 
- Most of users didn't uninstall the app 
- A few of users  uninstalled the app the same day as first use date


Characters of users in cluster #4: 

- Use iPhone 5
- 12 days of app launch from installation
- Most of users  revoked push token before first use date or on the same day as 
- Most of users didn't uninstall the app 
- A few of users uninstalled the app 0-3 day since first use date


Characters of users in cluster #5: 

- Use iPhone 6 Plus
- 11 days of app launch from installation
- Most of users revoked push token before first use date or 1-2 days after first use date
- Half of users didn't uninstall the app 
- A few of users uninstalled the app 9-10 days since first use date

Characters of users in cluster #6: 

- Use iPhone 5c
- 8 days of app launch from installation
- Most of users revoked push token before first use date or 0-1 days after first use date
- Most of users didn't uninstall the app 
 
Characters of users in cluster #7: 

- Use iPhone 4S
- 9 days of app launch from installation
- Most of users revoked push token before first use date or the same day as first use date
- Most of users didn't uninstall the app 
- A few of users uninstalled the app 7 days since first use date

Characters of users in cluster #8: 

- Use iPhone 6
- 6 days of app launch from installation
- Most of users didn't revoked push token before first use date but revoked 6-7 days after first use date
- Most of users didn't uninstall the app 
- A few of users uninstalled the app 23 days since first use date

Characters of users in cluster #9: 

- Use iPad mini 2G
- 3 days of app launch from installation
- Most of users  revoked push token before first use  
- Half of users  uninstalled the app 0-1 day since first use date

3. Affinity propagation
 
#features = 7 from Set1
#clusters = 39 
Silhouette coefficient = 0.77571306380306715

It seems that the clusters are mainly divided by device model. 


Note that Silhouette coefficient from Affinity propagation is highest because it returned higher number of clusters (Silhouette coefficient tend to be higher when there are many clusters) 

4. Cobweb 

Each concept correspons to one cluster. The advantage of cobweb is that it returns a description of a concept. Categorical and boolean features are printed with their counts. Numerical features are printed with their means and standard deviation in parenthesis. 



Note that the silhouette coefficient was calculated using different data format than the format that cobweb learned. (The silhouette coefficient is based on a distance function but cobweb algorithm clusters data based on probability. )



5. DBSCAN: returned very poor clustering results. So I won't discuss about it.
