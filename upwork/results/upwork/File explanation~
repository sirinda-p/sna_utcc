I have uploaded files containing results and discussion as follows: 
(You may read them in order as shown here)

1. clustering_steps.docx - A document explain how I did all clustering algorithms with some data exploration. 

2. experiment_summary - A summary of all clustering results 

3. Files containing centroid vectors:

kmeans_centroid_vectors_best.csv  
birch_centroid_vectors_best.csv
affinity_centroid_vectors_best.csv

4. kmeans_result.docx - kmeans clustering result on Friday Nov 20, 2015. I reran this experiment with more parameter settings. See the new results in xx

5. kmeans_summary_all.docx - A document explains how I did kmeans clustering. I rewrote and renamed it to clustering_steps.docx. So you may skip this file if you'd like. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. I am making my code reproducible and adding comments.  How would you like the final code look like?
