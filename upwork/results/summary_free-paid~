Prediction accuracy = 0.949458483755

Logistic regression
Prediction accuracy = 0.965342960289

Decision tree
Prediction accuracy = 0.982671480144

I will use features from logistic regression to explain datasets (since it got the higher accuracy rate. The weights from the decision tree have different meaning and can't be used for explanation. )
