Hi David

I have some questions as follows:
1. What is # age in days of App launch from App installation INTEGER? 
Is it (the latest date that a user use the app) - (the installaion date)? 

2. What is # Date of Last Update by SDK (still operating) DATETIME? 
3. What is # Push Token revoked TRUE/FALSE? (This attribute is actually in DATETIME)


For the following attributes, negative_feedback and uninstalled, I will convert them to number of days the users 
blocked push notification/uninstalled the app since they fisrt used the app (install.created).

where
negative_feedback = # User has blocked push after initially accepting TRUE/FALSE (it is in DATETIME) 
uninstalled = # Did the user remove this App TRUE/FALSE (it is in DATETIME) 

So we will get
blocked_push_days = negative_feedback - install.created 
uninstalled_days = uninstalled - install.created 

This is from my assumption that dissatisfied users will block push notification or uninstall the app
sooner than satisfied users after their first date of using the app.

And I won't use the attributes: install.created, negative_feedback, uninstalled_days.  

I also think I will convert the attributes in question #2 (SDK last update) and #3 (Push token revoked) 
to number of days from some reference date (maybe the installation date? do we have the installation date?)
