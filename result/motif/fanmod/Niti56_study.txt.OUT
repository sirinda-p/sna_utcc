FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\fanmod_results\motif_edgelist\Niti56_study.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 86
Number of edges: 98
Number of single edges: 83
Number of mutual edges: 15

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

414 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
524104 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
524518 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 537511 tries were made, 241914 were successful.
Randomization took 0.399 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.684 seconds.
