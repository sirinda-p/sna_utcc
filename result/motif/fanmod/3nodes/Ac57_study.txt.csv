FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\Ac57_study.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 313
Number of edges: 181
Number of single edges: 133
Number of mutual edges: 48

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

889 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
1125590 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
1126479 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 811364 tries were made, 510125 were successful.
Randomization took 0.456 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.939 seconds.
