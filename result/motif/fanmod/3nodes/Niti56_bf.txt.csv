FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\Niti56_bf.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 86
Number of edges: 89
Number of single edges: 53
Number of mutual edges: 36

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

189 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
336748 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
336937 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 399246 tries were made, 249036 were successful.
Randomization took 0.159 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.238 seconds.
