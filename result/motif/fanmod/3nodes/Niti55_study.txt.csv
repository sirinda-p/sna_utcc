FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\Niti55_study.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 92
Number of edges: 98
Number of single edges: 87
Number of mutual edges: 11

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

424 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
456064 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
456488 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 462257 tries were made, 267640 were successful.
Randomization took 0.284 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.482 seconds.
