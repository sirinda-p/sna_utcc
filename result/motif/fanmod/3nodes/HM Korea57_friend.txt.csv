FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\HM Korea57_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 8086
Number of edges: 202
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 202

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

1177 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
1766616 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
1767793 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 1309470 tries were made, 395243 were successful.
Randomization took 0.5 seconds.
Enumeration took 1.611 seconds.
