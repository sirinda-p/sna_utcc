FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\Ac57_bf.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 313
Number of edges: 95
Number of single edges: 46
Number of mutual edges: 49

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

162 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
238504 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
238666 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 334545 tries were made, 283836 were successful.
Randomization took 0.194 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.207 seconds.
