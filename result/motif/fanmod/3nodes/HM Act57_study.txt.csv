FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\HM Act57_study.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 6033
Number of edges: 12
Number of single edges: 11
Number of mutual edges: 1

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

22 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
22000 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
22022 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 108108 tries were made, 0 were successful.
Randomization took 0.039 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.158 seconds.
