FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\Niti55_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 92
Number of edges: 235
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 235

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

2059 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
2525560 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
2527619 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 1712390 tries were made, 327818 were successful.
Randomization took 0.543 seconds.
Enumeration took 1.867 seconds.
