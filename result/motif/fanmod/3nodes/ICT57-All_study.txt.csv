FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist_3nodes\ICT57-All_study.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 44021
Number of edges: 145
Number of single edges: 128
Number of mutual edges: 17

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

852 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
1006970 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
1007822 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 779833 tries were made, 357754 were successful.
Randomization took 0.447 seconds.
Enumeration took 1.594 seconds.
