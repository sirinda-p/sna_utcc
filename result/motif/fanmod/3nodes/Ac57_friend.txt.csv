FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\Ac57_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 313
Number of edges: 442
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 442

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

4922 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
6697012 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
6701934 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 3314454 tries were made, 564539 were successful.
Randomization took 1.219 seconds.
Enumeration took 5.894 seconds.
