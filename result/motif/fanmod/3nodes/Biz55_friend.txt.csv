FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\Biz55_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 8604
Number of edges: 268
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 268

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

2119 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
2720166 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
2722285 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 1696298 tries were made, 533514 were successful.
Randomization took 0.751 seconds.
Enumeration took 2.629 seconds.
