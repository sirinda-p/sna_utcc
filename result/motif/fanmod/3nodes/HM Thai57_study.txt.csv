FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\HM Thai57_study.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 3023
Number of edges: 37
Number of single edges: 28
Number of mutual edges: 9

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

137 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
135368 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
135505 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 318739 tries were made, 13147 were successful.
Randomization took 0.084 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.196 seconds.
