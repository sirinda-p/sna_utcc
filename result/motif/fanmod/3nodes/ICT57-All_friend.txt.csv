FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist_3nodes\ICT57-All_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 44021
Number of edges: 889
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 889

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

16353 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
20068580 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
20084933 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 7808594 tries were made, 188166 were successful.
Randomization took 2.552 seconds.
Enumeration took 22.859 seconds.
