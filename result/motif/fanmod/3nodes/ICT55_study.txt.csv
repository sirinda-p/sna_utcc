FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\ICT55_study.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 4082
Number of edges: 110
Number of single edges: 97
Number of mutual edges: 13

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

493 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
566440 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
566933 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 501743 tries were made, 307028 were successful.
Randomization took 0.238 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.447 seconds.
