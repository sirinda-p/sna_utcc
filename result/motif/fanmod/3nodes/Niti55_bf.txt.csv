FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\Niti55_bf.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 92
Number of edges: 139
Number of single edges: 80
Number of mutual edges: 59

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

508 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
683468 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
683976 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 587641 tries were made, 401609 were successful.
Randomization took 0.269 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.446 seconds.
