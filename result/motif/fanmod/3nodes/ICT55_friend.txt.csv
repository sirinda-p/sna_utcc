FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\ICT55_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 4087
Number of edges: 617
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 617

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

11143 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
11511600 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
11522743 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 5415304 tries were made, 133262 were successful.
Randomization took 1.648 seconds.
Enumeration took 12.567 seconds.
