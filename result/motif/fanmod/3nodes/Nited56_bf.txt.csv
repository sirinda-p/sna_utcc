FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\Nited56_bf.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 3159
Number of edges: 217
Number of single edges: 137
Number of mutual edges: 80

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

815 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
1249142 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
1249957 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 873423 tries were made, 632786 were successful.
Randomization took 0.483 seconds.
Enumeration took 1.03 seconds.
