FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\HM Korea57_study.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 8086
Number of edges: 117
Number of single edges: 86
Number of mutual edges: 31

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

419 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
616042 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
616461 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 566792 tries were made, 314786 were successful.
Randomization took 0.255 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.577 seconds.
