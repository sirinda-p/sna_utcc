FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\Nited56_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 3164
Number of edges: 458
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 458

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

4321 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
5456478 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
5460799 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 2610938 tries were made, 1089131 were successful.
Randomization took 1.393 seconds.
Enumeration took 5.127 seconds.
