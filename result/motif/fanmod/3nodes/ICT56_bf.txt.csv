FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\ICT56_bf.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 4065
Number of edges: 100
Number of single edges: 49
Number of mutual edges: 51

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

391 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
539250 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
539641 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 558378 tries were made, 244038 were successful.
Randomization took 0.274 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.583 seconds.
