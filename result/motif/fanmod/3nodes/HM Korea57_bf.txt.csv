FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\HM Korea57_bf.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 8086
Number of edges: 88
Number of single edges: 70
Number of mutual edges: 18

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

245 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
303048 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
303293 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 339027 tries were made, 259261 were successful.
Randomization took 0.18 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.344 seconds.
