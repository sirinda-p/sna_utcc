FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\HM Act57_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 6034
Number of edges: 115
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 115

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

1114 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
1109612 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
1110726 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 1034315 tries were made, 1682 were successful.
Randomization took 0.239 seconds.
Enumeration took 1.093 seconds.
