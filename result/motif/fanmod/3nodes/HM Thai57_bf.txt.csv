FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\HM Thai57_bf.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 3023
Number of edges: 31
Number of single edges: 21
Number of mutual edges: 10

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

73 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
106544 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
106617 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 241136 tries were made, 32459 were successful.
Randomization took 0.084 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.199 seconds.
