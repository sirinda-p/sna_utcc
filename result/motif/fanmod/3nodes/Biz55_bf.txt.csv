FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\Biz55_bf.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 8187
Number of edges: 114
Number of single edges: 78
Number of mutual edges: 36

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

322 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
419872 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
420194 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 432340 tries were made, 336592 were successful.
Randomization took 0.276 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.592 seconds.
