FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\EC55_bf.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 248
Number of edges: 113
Number of single edges: 73
Number of mutual edges: 40

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

281 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
412904 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
413185 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 434547 tries were made, 333522 were successful.
Randomization took 0.209 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.291 seconds.
