FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\EC55_study.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 245
Number of edges: 158
Number of single edges: 134
Number of mutual edges: 24

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

701 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
1002642 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
1003343 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 747104 tries were made, 434608 were successful.
Randomization took 0.416 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.823 seconds.
