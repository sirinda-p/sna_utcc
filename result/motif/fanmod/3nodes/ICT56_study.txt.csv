FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\ICT56_study.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 4065
Number of edges: 105
Number of single edges: 87
Number of mutual edges: 18

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

594 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
671184 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
671778 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 698289 tries were made, 188365 were successful.
Randomization took 0.242 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.534 seconds.
