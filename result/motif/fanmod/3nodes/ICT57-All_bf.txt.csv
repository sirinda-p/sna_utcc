FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist_3nodes\ICT57-All_bf.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 44021
Number of edges: 149
Number of single edges: 76
Number of mutual edges: 73

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

481 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
768668 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
769149 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 654050 tries were made, 424877 were successful.
Randomization took 0.451 seconds.
Enumeration took 1.439 seconds.
