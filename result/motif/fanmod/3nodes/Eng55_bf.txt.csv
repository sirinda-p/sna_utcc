FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\Eng55_bf.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 1026
Number of edges: 53
Number of single edges: 25
Number of mutual edges: 28

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

173 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
221142 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
221315 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 346393 tries were made, 101675 were successful.
Randomization took 0.127 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.212 seconds.
