FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\HM Thai57_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 3023
Number of edges: 69
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 69

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

343 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
343000 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
343343 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 620954 tries were made, 648 were successful.
Randomization took 0.119 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.375 seconds.
