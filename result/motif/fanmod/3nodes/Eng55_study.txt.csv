FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\Eng55_study.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 1025
Number of edges: 60
Number of single edges: 45
Number of mutual edges: 15

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

259 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
285624 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
285883 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 458740 tries were made, 68613 were successful.
Randomization took 0.159 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.343 seconds.
