FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\ICT55_bf.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 4082
Number of edges: 148
Number of single edges: 88
Number of mutual edges: 60

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

548 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
749638 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
750186 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 616799 tries were made, 429933 were successful.
Randomization took 0.347 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.538 seconds.
