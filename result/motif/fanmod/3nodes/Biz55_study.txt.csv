FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\Biz55_study.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 8182
Number of edges: 47
Number of single edges: 44
Number of mutual edges: 3

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

115 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
117212 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
117327 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 200683 tries were made, 133680 were successful.
Randomization took 0.127 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.293 seconds.
