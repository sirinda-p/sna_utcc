FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\Nited56_study.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 3159
Number of edges: 165
Number of single edges: 140
Number of mutual edges: 25

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

690 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
851580 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
852270 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 691899 tries were made, 467219 were successful.
Randomization took 0.362 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.709 seconds.
