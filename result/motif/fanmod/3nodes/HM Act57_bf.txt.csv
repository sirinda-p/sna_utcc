FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist\HM Act57_bf.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 6033
Number of edges: 17
Number of single edges: 12
Number of mutual edges: 5

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

25 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
34654 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
34679 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 99143 tries were made, 36653 were successful.
Randomization took 0.051 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.168 seconds.
