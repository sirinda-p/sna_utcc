FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\fanmod_results\motif_edgelist\Niti56_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 86
Number of edges: 376
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 376

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

5667 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
6435966 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
6441633 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 3342622 tries were made, 42536 were successful.
Randomization took 1.132 seconds.
Enumeration took 10.037 seconds.
