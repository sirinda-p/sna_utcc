FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\fanmod_results\motif_edgelist\Niti56_bf.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 86
Number of edges: 89
Number of single edges: 53
Number of mutual edges: 36

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

189 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
336858 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
337047 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 398638 tries were made, 249075 were successful.
Randomization took 0.368 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.37 seconds.
