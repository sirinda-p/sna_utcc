FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist_4nodes\Niti55_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 92
Number of edges: 235
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 235

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

19754 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
28114885 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
28134639 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 1713018 tries were made, 327910 were successful.
Randomization took 0.501 seconds.
Enumeration took 31.423 seconds.
