FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist_4nodes\HM Korea57_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 8086
Number of edges: 202
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 202

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

7554 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
16250622 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
16258176 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 1309324 tries were made, 395122 were successful.
Randomization took 0.457 seconds.
Enumeration took 18.1 seconds.
