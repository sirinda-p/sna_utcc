FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist_4nodes\Eng55_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 1027
Number of edges: 177
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 177

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

4787 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
4785948 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
4790735 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 1593837 tries were made, 760 were successful.
Randomization took 0.282 seconds.
Enumeration took 8.4 seconds.
