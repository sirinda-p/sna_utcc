FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist_4nodes\Biz55_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 8604
Number of edges: 268
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 268

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

18000 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
31880361 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
31898361 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 1696627 tries were made, 533992 were successful.
Randomization took 0.649 seconds.
Enumeration took 35.936 seconds.
