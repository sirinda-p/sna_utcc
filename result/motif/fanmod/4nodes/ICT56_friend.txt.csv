FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist_4nodes\ICT56_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 4065
Number of edges: 320
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 320

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

29429 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
31631598 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
31661027 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 2877837 tries were made, 4974 were successful.
Randomization took 0.658 seconds.
Enumeration took 45.686 seconds.
