FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist_4nodes\ICT55_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 4087
Number of edges: 617
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 617

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

160672 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
165150008 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
165310680 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 5417144 tries were made, 131654 were successful.
Randomization took 1.573 seconds.
Enumeration took 222.395 seconds.
