FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist_4nodes\HM Act57_study.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 6033
Number of edges: 12
Number of single edges: 11
Number of mutual edges: 1

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

24 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
24000 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
24024 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 108108 tries were made, 0 were successful.
Randomization took 0.033 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.203 seconds.
