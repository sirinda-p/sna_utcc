FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist_4nodes\EC55_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 248
Number of edges: 320
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 320

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

21131 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
44805110 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
44826241 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 2172168 tries were made, 558945 were successful.
Randomization took 0.714 seconds.
Enumeration took 49.793 seconds.
