FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\Amm\Desktop\motif_edgelist\motif_edgelist_4nodes\Niti56_friend.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 86
Number of edges: 376
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 376

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

76482 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
89934011 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
90010493 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 3345834 tries were made, 39486 were successful.
Randomization took 0.848 seconds.
Enumeration took 107.169 seconds.
