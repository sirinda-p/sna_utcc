After I explored the dataset, I would like to confirm with you that:

1. There are logs of a mobile app (from the data, it seems like all of them are from iOS devices). 
 
2. According to the attribute explanation, the total number of attrbutes is 36. 

3. Some attributes do not have TRUE/FALSE values, but are in DATETIME.  
Those attributes are 
# User has blocked push after initially accepting
# Push Token revoked TRUE/FALSE
# Did the user remove this App TRUE/FALSE 

4. There are 94 rows that have 37 attributes. The extra attribute is between 

the attribute "# Userâ€™s Device Model STRING eg iphone"  and
the atrribute "# User has blocked push after initially accepting TRUE/FALSE" 

Values of the extra attribute are 
['1 from StreetHawk', '8 from StreetHawk', '4 from StreetHawk', '3 from StreetHawk', '2 from StreetHawk', '7 from StreetHawk']

Should I ignore the extra attribute? I don't know what it is.
